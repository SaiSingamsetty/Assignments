## DotNet Assignment NowFloats

#### NOTE : Please run the project in Visual Studio for better understanding. 

I have made a windows application to complete the task.
It will store all the images in "~/Images/"

  ##### Downloaded.jpg is the input file
  ##### FinalImage.jpg is the output file
  ##### (Part.jpg files are the sliced images)
  
*** Please don't run executable file. The outputs are stored in Images folder in Project folder as it will be difficult to display all the images on windows form ***
